# Business-Focused AI Risk & Decision Review

This section translates AI risk and governance principles into **business and product decision language**.

It is designed for situations where AI systems support **commercial decisions** such as targeting, prioritization, pricing support, or operational optimization.

---

## Business Objective First

AI should be evaluated based on the **decision it informs**, not the sophistication of the model.

Before any technical discussion, the following questions must be answered:

- What business decision will the AI system support?
- Who owns that decision?
- What is the cost of a wrong decision?
- What is the non-AI baseline today?

If these questions cannot be answered clearly, AI deployment should be reconsidered.

---

## Decision Mapping

A clear distinction must be made between:
- **AI output** (scores, rankings, predictions)
- **Business decision** (actions taken based on those outputs)

AI outputs should be treated as **decision inputs**, not automatic instructions.

Key checks:
- Is the AI advisory or automated?
- Can humans override the output?
- Are override decisions documented?

---

## Risk Review (Business Perspective)

### Financial Risk
- What is the expected cost of false positives?
- What is the cost of false negatives?
- Are thresholds conservative by default?

### Customer / User Risk
- Will users perceive the AI’s involvement?
- Could this affect trust, fairness, or experience?
- Is there a human appeal or review path?

---

## Model Use and Limits

From a business perspective, it must be explicitly documented that:

- Predictive models estimate likelihood, not intent
- Prediction does not imply causation
- Model outputs degrade over time as behavior changes

What the model **cannot** support should be stated as clearly as what it can.

---

## Go / No-Go Business Decision

AI deployment should require an explicit business decision, supported by:

- A named business owner
- A defined success metric (KPI)
- Clear risk tolerance
- A rollback or pause mechanism

Possible outcomes:
- Go
- Go with constraints
- No-Go

Each outcome must be justified in writing.

---

## Post-Deployment Review

After launch, the business must review:
- Whether KPIs improved as expected
- Whether decision behavior changed unintentionally
- Whether teams over-relied on AI outputs

If AI increases operational complexity without measurable benefit, continued use should be questioned.

## How This Section Is Used

This framework can be used as:
- A pre-launch decision review
- A PM / analytics alignment document
- An appendix to an executive decision memo
- A governance artifact for internal review
