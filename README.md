# AI Risk & Compliance Checklist

An operational toolkit for reviewing AI systems in **business decision-making contexts**.

This repository provides practical checklists, decision frameworks, and review artifacts to help teams evaluate **whether, when, and how** AI systems should be deployed—focusing on accountability, risk, and governance rather than model performance alone.

---

## Who This Is For

This toolkit is designed for:
- Product managers and analytics leads
- Business and operations teams deploying AI-supported decisions
- Risk, compliance, and governance stakeholders
- Organizations seeking responsible AI adoption without over-automation

**This is not a legal opinion or a technical model audit.**

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start with the **core checklist** to define the AI use case and decision context  
2. Apply the **business-focused review** to assess risks and deployment readiness  
3. Review a **worked example** to see how the framework applies in practice  
4. Use templates to document decisions and governance rationale

## Core Principles

- **Decision-first, not model-first**  
  AI is evaluated based on the decisions it informs, not the sophistication of the model.

- **Prediction is not causation**  
  Predictive outputs are treated as decision inputs, not explanations or guarantees.

- **Human accountability by design**  
  Final decisions remain with clearly identified human owners.

- **Explicit limits and uncertainty**  
  What the system cannot do is documented alongside what it can.
